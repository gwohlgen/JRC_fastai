# JRC_fastai
fast.ai notebooks for JRC dataset - multilabel classification.

## Notebooks

We did the computations for **3 variants**: 

* with all EuroVoc labels in the dataset (3562 classes). Filenames: *all_labels_*
* microthesauri variant (126 classes). Filenames: *microthesauri_*
* topterms variant. Filenames: *topterms_*

Further, for any variant we ran experiments on corpora **without and with preprocessing** of the text applied.

A publication describing the work is under review at K-CAP 2019 conference.
