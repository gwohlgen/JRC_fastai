# JRC_fastai
fast.ai notebooks for JRC and the KED datasets - multilabel classification.

New: additionally to JRC and KED, we also included in results for the Reuters dataset.

## Notebooks

We did the computations for **3 variants** of both datasets: 

* with all EuroVoc labels in the dataset (3562 classes). Filenames: *all_labels_*
* microthesauri variant (126 classes). Filenames: *microthesauri_*
* topterms variant. Filenames: *topterms_*

Further, for most variants we ran experiments on corpora **without and with preprocessing** of the text applied.
In the research paper submitted to COOPIS 2019, we focus on the **preprocessed** versions, as those provide better results.
