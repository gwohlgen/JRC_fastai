       "xxbos [ pic ] | xxup commission xxup of xxup the xxup european xxup communities | xxmaj brussels , xxup com ( 2004 ) xxmaj proposal for a xxup directive / / â€¦ â€¦ xxup ec xxup of xxup the xxup european xxup parliament xxup and xxup of xxup the xxup council of [ ] â€¦ on reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterway vessels ( xxmaj codified version ) xxup explanatory xxup memorandum 1 . xxmaj in the context of a people â€™ s xxmaj europe , the xxmaj commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying xxmaj community law so as to make it clearer and more accessible to the ordinary citizen , thus giving him new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives him . xxmaj this aim can not be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times , often quite substantially , remain scattered , so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones . xxmaj considerable research work , comparing many different instruments , is thus needed to identify the current rules . xxmaj for this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if xxmaj community law is to be clear and transparent . 2 . xxmaj on 1 xxmaj april 1987 the xxmaj commission therefore decided [ 1 ] to instruct its staff that all legislative acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments , stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible , to ensure that the xxmaj community rules are clear and readily understandable . 3 . xxmaj the xxmaj conclusions of the xxmaj presidency of the xxmaj edinburgh xxmaj european xxmaj council ( xxmaj december 1992 ) confirmed this [ 2 ] , stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time . xxmaj codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal xxmaj community legislative procedure . xxmaj given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the xxmaj european xxmaj parliament , the xxmaj council and the xxmaj commission have agreed , by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 xxmaj december 1994 , that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast - track adoption of codification instruments . 4 . xxmaj the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of xxmaj council xxmaj directive 76 / 135 / xxup eec of 20 xxmaj january 1976 on reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterway vessels [ 3 ] . xxmaj the new xxmaj directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it [ 4 ] , this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself . 5 . xxmaj the codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation , in all official languages , of xxmaj directive 76 / 135 / xxup eec and the instrument amending it , carried out by the xxmaj office for xxmaj official xxmaj publications of the xxmaj european xxmaj communities , by means of a data - processing system . xxmaj where the xxmaj articles have been given new numbers , the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in xxmaj annex xxup iii to the codified xxmaj directive . 76 / 135 / xxup eec ( adapted ) xxmaj proposal for a xxup directive / / â€¦ â€¦ xxup ec xxup of xxup the xxup european xxup parliament xxup and xxup of xxup the xxup council of [ ] â€¦ on reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterway vessels ( xxmaj text with xxup eea relevance ) xxup the xxup european xxup parliament xxup and xxup the xxup council xxup of xxup the xxup european xxup union , xxmaj having regard to the xxmaj treaty establishing the xxmaj european xxmaj community , and in particular xxmaj article 71 thereof , xxmaj having regard to the proposal from the xxmaj commission , xxmaj having regard to the opinion of the xxmaj european xxmaj economic and xxmaj social xxmaj committee [ 5 ] , xxmaj having regard to the opinion of the xxmaj committee of the xxmaj regions [ 6 ] , xxmaj acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in xxmaj article 251 of the xxmaj treaty [ 7 ] , xxmaj whereas : 1 . xxmaj council xxmaj directive 76 / 135 / xxup eec of 20 xxmaj january 1976 on reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterway vessels [ 8 ] has been substantially amended [ 9 ] . xxmaj in the interests of clarity and rationality the said xxmaj directive should be codified . 76 / 135 / xxup eec xxmaj recital 1 ( adapted ) 2 . xxmaj reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterways vessels should be achieved with a view to improving the safety of inland navigation in the xxmaj community . 76 / 135 / xxup eec xxmaj recital 2 3 . xxmaj it is necessary to establish under what circumstances and on what conditions xxmaj member xxmaj states may interrupt the passage of a vessel . 4 . xxmaj this xxmaj directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the xxmaj member xxmaj states relating to the time - limits for transposition into national law of the xxmaj directives set out in xxmaj annex xxup ii , xxmaj part b , 76 / 135 / xxup eec xxup have xxup adopted xxup this xxup directive : xxmaj article 1 xxmaj this xxmaj directive

expired . xxmaj the certificate issued pursuant to the xxmaj regulation on inspection of shipping on the xxmaj rhine shall be accepted as evidence , within the meaning of paragraphs 3 and 5 , for its full duration . 3 . xxmaj member xxmaj states may require that the technical specifications laid down in the xxmaj regulation on inspection of shipping on the xxmaj rhine are complied with . xxmaj they may require the certificate referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 as proof of this . 4 . xxmaj member xxmaj states may require vessels carrying dangerous goods as defined in the

out of workers for use by an undertaking in the framework of a public or a private contract , ( 5 ) xxmaj whereas any such promotion of the transnational provision of services requires a climate of fair competition and measures guaranteeing respect for the rights of workers , ( 6 ) xxmaj whereas the xxunk of the employment relationship raises problems with regard to the legislation applicable to the employment relationship , whereas it is in the interests of the parties to lay down the terms and conditions governing the employment relationship envisaged , ( 7 ) xxmaj whereas the xxmaj rome xxmaj convention of 19 xxmaj june 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations ( 4 ) , signed by 12 xxmaj member xxmaj states , entered into force on 1 xxmaj april 1991 in the majority of xxmaj member xxmaj states , ( 8 ) xxmaj whereas xxmaj article 3 of that xxmaj convention provides , as a general rule , for the free choice of law made by the parties , whereas , in the absence of choice , the contract is to be governed , according to xxmaj article 6 ( 2 ) , by the law of the country , in which the employee habitually carries out his work in performance of the contract , even if he is temporarily employed in another country , or , if the employee does not habitually carry out his work in any one country , by the law of the country in which the place of business through which he was engaged is situated , unless it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country , in which case the contract is to be governed by the law of that country , ( 9 ) xxmaj whereas , according to xxmaj article 6 ( 1 ) of the said xxmaj convention , the choice of law made by the parties is not to have the result of depriving the employee of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory rules of the law which would be applicable under paragraph 2 of that xxmaj article in the absence of choice , ( 10 ) xxmaj whereas xxmaj article 7 of the said xxmaj convention lays down , subject to certain conditions , that effect may be given , concurrently with the law declared applicable , to the mandatory rules of the law of another country , in particular the law of the xxmaj member xxmaj state within whose territory the worker is temporarily posted , ( 11 ) xxmaj whereas , according to the principle of precedence of xxmaj community law laid down in its xxmaj article 20 , the said xxmaj convention does not affect the application of provisions which , in relation to a particular matter , lay down choice - of - law rules relating to contractual obligations and which are or will be contained in acts of the institutions of the xxmaj european xxmaj communities or in national laws harmonized in implementation of such acts , ( 12 ) xxmaj whereas xxmaj community law does not preclude xxmaj member xxmaj states from applying their legislation , or collective agreements entered into by employers and labour , to any person who is employed , even temporarily , within their territory , although his employer is established in another xxmaj member xxmaj state , whereas xxmaj community law does not forbid xxmaj member xxmaj states to guarantee the observance of those rules by the appropriate means , ( 13 ) xxmaj whereas the laws of the xxmaj member xxmaj states must be coordinated in order to lay down a nucleus of mandatory rules for minimum protection to be observed in the host country by employers who post workers to perform temporary work in the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state where the services are provided , whereas such coordination can be achieved only by means of xxmaj community law , ( 14 ) xxmaj whereas a ' hard core ` of clearly defined protective rules should be observed by the provider of the services notwithstanding the duration of the worker 's posting , ( 15 ) xxmaj whereas it should be laid down that , in certain clearly defined cases of assembly and / or installation of goods , the provisions on minimum rates of pay and minimum paid annual holidays do not apply , ( 16 ) xxmaj whereas there should also be some flexibility in application of the provisions concerning minimum rates of pay and the minimum length of paid annual holidays , whereas , when the length of the posting is not more than one month , xxmaj member xxmaj states may , under certain conditions , derogate from the provisions concerning minimum rates of pay or provide for the possibility of derogation by means of collective agreements , whereas , where the amount of work to be done is not significant , xxmaj member xxmaj states may derogate from the provisions concerning minimum rates of pay and the minimum length of paid annual holidays , ( 17 ) xxmaj whereas the mandatory rules for minimum protection in force in the host country must not prevent the application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers , ( 18 ) xxmaj whereas the principle that undertakings established outside the xxmaj community must not receive more favourable treatment than undertakings established in the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state should be upheld , ( 19 ) xxmaj whereas , without prejudice to other provisions of xxmaj community law , this xxmaj directive does not entail the obligation to give legal recognition to the existence of temporary employment undertakings , nor does it prejudice the application by xxmaj member xxmaj states of their laws concerning the hiring - out of workers and temporary employment undertakings to undertakings not established in their territory but operating therein in the framework of the provision of services , ( 20 ) xxmaj whereas this xxmaj directive does not affect either the agreements concluded by the xxmaj community with third countries or the laws of xxmaj member xxmaj states concerning the access to their territory of third -

employed persons and to members of their families moving within the xxmaj community and xxmaj council xxmaj regulation ( xxup eec ) xxmaj no 574 / 72 laying down the procedure for implementing xxmaj regulation ( xxup eec ) xxmaj no 1408 / 71 \" ( xxup com ( 2004 ) 830 final xxup cod 2004 / xxunk â€” ) ( 2006 / c 24 / 09 ) xxmaj on 14 xxmaj january 2005 , the xxmaj council decided to consult the xxmaj european xxmaj economic and xxmaj social xxmaj committee , under xxmaj article 251 of the xxmaj treaty establishing the xxmaj european xxmaj community , on the abovementioned proposal . xxmaj the xxmaj section for xxmaj employment , xxmaj social xxmaj affairs and xxmaj citizenship , which was responsible for the xxmaj committee 's work on the subject , adopted its opinion on 5 xxmaj september 2005 ( xxmaj rapporteur : xxmaj mr xxmaj rodrÃ­guez xxmaj garcÃ­a - xxmaj caro ) . xxmaj at its 420th plenary session held on 28 and 29 xxmaj september 2005 ( meeting of 28 xxmaj september ) , the xxmaj european xxmaj economic and xxmaj social xxmaj committee adopted the following opinion with 171 votes in favour and four abstentions . 1 . xxmaj introduction 1.1 xxmaj since their adoption , xxmaj regulations xxmaj nos . 1408 / 71 and 574 / 72 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self - employed persons and to members of their families moving within the xxmaj community have been successively amended to accommodate the changes that these schemes and the benefits they provide have undergone in the course of time . 1.2 xxmaj these changes basically consist of bringing the xxmaj regulations into line with the legislative amendments that have been made in the xxmaj member xxmaj states and adapting them to the successive rulings of the xxmaj european xxmaj court of xxmaj justice . xxmaj consequently , the proposed xxmaj regulation now submitted for the xxmaj committee 's consideration aims to reflect the changes that have taken place in national legislation , principally in the new xxmaj member xxmaj states , and to complete the simplification of procedures on receiving medical treatment abroad , extending this modification to the procedures regarding benefits for eventualities arising from accidents at work and occupational diseases . 1.3 xxmaj the last modification made to the two xxmaj regulations was produced by xxmaj regulation 631 / 2004 [ 1 ] , which introduced the aforementioned changes to the procedures for receiving medical treatment in another xxmaj member xxmaj state . xxmaj the xxmaj committee delivered an opinion [ 2 ] on the regulation at the draft stage . 1.4 xxmaj nevertheless , the most substantial change to the coordination of social security schemes in the xxup eu xxmaj member xxmaj states was made by xxmaj regulation 883 / 2004 [ 3 ] of the xxmaj european xxmaj parliament and of the xxmaj council which , after six years of discussion in the xxmaj union 's institutions , has been adopted and published in the xxmaj official xxmaj journal of the xxmaj european xxmaj union . xxmaj this xxmaj regulation , replacing xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 , has not yet entered into force , pending adoption of its xxmaj implementing xxmaj regulation , which will in turn replace the current xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 574 / 72 . xxmaj the xxup eesc delivered an opinion [ 4 ] on the proposal for a xxmaj regulation on the coordination of social security schemes when it was presented by the xxmaj commission . 2 . xxmaj content of the proposal 2.1 xxmaj the proposal presents modifications to two xxmaj regulations , firstly xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 and secondly xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 574 / 72 establishing the implementing procedures of the former . xxmaj the two sets of amendments are not related to one another , because they arise from different legal aspects , as stated in point 1.2 of this xxmaj opinion . 2.1.1 xxmaj as regards xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 , modifications are made to several of its annexes . xxmaj these address particular situations in the different xxmaj member xxmaj states , which must be referred to specifically in these annexes if the citizens of those countries are to benefit accordingly . 2.1.2 xxmaj as regards xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 574 / 72 , the modifications simplify the text and reduce the current administrative burden when healthcare is received for accidents at work or occupational diseases in another xxmaj member xxmaj state , applying the same criteria for simplifying procedures for receiving general healthcare as set out in xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 631 / 2004 . 3 . xxmaj general comments 3.1 xxmaj the xxmaj committee welcomes the content of the proposal because it considers that this pursues the approach of improving and simplifying the procedures aimed at better coordination of social security schemes in the xxmaj european xxmaj union . xxmaj any change that benefits xxup eu citizens and improves their relationship with the public authorities in the xxmaj member xxmaj states will always be welcomed by this xxmaj committee . 3.2 xxmaj we also welcome the proposed regulation because it specifically promotes one of the four freedoms on which the xxmaj european xxmaj union was originally founded â€” the free movement of workers and now , and by extension of this right , the free movement of those persons affected by these rules . xxmaj the xxmaj committee must therefore once again call for the various xxmaj union and xxmaj member xxmaj state bodies to move ahead with eliminating all existing obstacles , in order to create both a genuine area of free movement for persons within the xxmaj union 's borders , and a real social right . xxmaj we welcome the content of the proposal , because it constitutes a new means of promoting a fundamental right , which applies to all citizens . 3.3 xxmaj the co - decision procedure , because of its lengthy nature , may result in significant changes to the content of the proposals . xxmaj in an earlier xxmaj committee opinion [ 5 ] , on a proposal for partial amendments to the two regulations , we expressed our views on the need to participate and to give our opinion in real time , especially when dealing with this type of proposal , which relates to changes in socio - occupational legislation . xxmaj this view was ratified in another later xxup eesc opinion [ 6 ] , which argued that we should have the opportunity to comment on any changes made to texts during the decision - making procedure . xxmaj for these reasons , we would restate the need to take account of the xxup eesc 's role in this type of procedure . 3.4 xxmaj the situation described in point 3.3 has become even clearer with the adoption and publication of xxmaj regulation 883 / 2004 [ 7 ] on the coordination of social security schemes . xxmaj the opinion [ 8 ] delivered by the xxmaj committee stated the need to monitor the progress of the proposal , given its complexity and the certainty of changes to the text during the legislative process . xxmaj four years after the opinion was delivered , the xxmaj regulation has been adopted without the xxup eesc having again stated its views on the text . xxmaj given the importance of these types of rules and the crucial importance of the xxup eesc 's opinion being heard in good time , the xxmaj committee calls for the consultation procedure to be adapted to make the role played by organised civil society in the xxmaj union 's legislative procedure more effective . xxmaj equally , and in order to explain the view expressed by the xxmaj committee in the aforementioned opinion , we believe an own - initiative opinion should be drawn up on the new xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 on the coordination of social security schemes , which will eventually replace the current xxmaj regulation 1408 / 71 . 3.5 xxmaj similarly , the xxmaj committee considers that the consultative role of the xxmaj advisory xxmaj committee on xxmaj social xxmaj security for xxmaj migrant xxmaj workers , set up by xxmaj title v of xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 should be performed in exact compliance with the provisions of that regulation . xxmaj this committee , formed principally of trade union and employers ' representatives , is the forum through which socio - economic agents convey their views directly to the institutions , in the form of opinions or proposals , on the changes that need to be made to social security at xxmaj community level . 3.6 xxmaj article 90 of xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 states that xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 shall be repealed , except under certain circumstances , and xxmaj article 91 states that this xxmaj regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day after its publication in the xxmaj official xxmaj journal . xxmaj the second paragraph of the latter article states , however , that it shall apply from the date of entry into force of the xxmaj implementing xxmaj regulation . xxmaj for this reason , and given the forthcoming launch , in 2006 , of the xxmaj european xxmaj year of xxmaj workers ' xxmaj mobility , the xxmaj committee calls on the xxmaj union 's institutions and the xxmaj member xxmaj states to ensure that the procedure for drawing up and adopting the future implementing xxmaj regulation is as speedy and effective as possible so that the provisions of the new coordinating xxmaj regulation can enter into force to replace the complex provisions that make up the current xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 at the earliest opportunity . 4 . xxmaj specific comments 4.1 xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self - employed persons and to members of their families moving within the xxmaj community . 4.1.1 xxmaj article 1 of the proposal amends annexes i , xxup ii , iia , xxup iii , xxup iv and xxup vi of the xxmaj regulation . 4.1.2 xxmaj in order to incorporate the changes that have taken place in xxmaj slovak legislation , an amendment is made to xxmaj annex i , section xxup ii , which refers to the personal scope of the regulation as regards the meaning of the term \" member of the family \" . 4.1.3 xxmaj due to changes in xxmaj french legislation , an amendment is made to xxmaj annex xxup ii , section i , on special schemes for self - employed persons which are excluded from the scope of the xxmaj regulation . 4.1.4 xxmaj in order to reflect changes to legislation in xxmaj estonia , xxmaj latvia and xxmaj poland respectively , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup ii , section xxup ii on special childbirth or adoption allowances that are excluded from the scope of the xxmaj regulation . xxmaj this annex is also amended as regards xxmaj luxembourg , as a consequence of a xxup ecj ruling stipulating that special allowances for childbirth or adoption can not be excluded from the xxmaj regulation and are exportable family benefits . 4.1.5 xxmaj due to various updates and adaptations to the corresponding legislation in xxmaj germany , xxmaj latvia , xxmaj poland and xxmaj slovakia , amendments are made to xxmaj annex iia of the xxmaj regulation , concerning special non - contributory benefits . 4.1.6 xxmaj in order to eliminate unnecessary points and thus simplify its content , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup iii.a concerning provisions for social security agreements that continue to apply despite the xxmaj regulation 's provision on deleting them . xxmaj amendments are also made for the same purpose to xxmaj annex xxup xxunk on the provisions of social security agreements which do not apply to all persons to whom the xxmaj regulation applies . xxmaj the numbering is adjusted , and bilateral agreements that fulfil the conditions for being listed in the annex are included . 4.1.7 xxmaj due to an incorporation into the legislation of the xxmaj czech xxmaj republic , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup xxunk covering national legislation under which the amount of invalidity benefits is independent of the length of periods of insurance . xxmaj for the same reason and with regard to the xxmaj czech xxmaj republic and xxmaj estonia , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup xxunk , on cases where the double pension calculation may be waived as it will never lead to a higher result . xxmaj as a result of changes to legislation in xxmaj slovakia , an amendment is made to xxmaj annex xxup iv . d on the benefits and agreements regarding the overlapping of benefits of the same kind to which persons are entitled under legislation in two or more xxmaj member xxmaj states . 4.1.8 xxmaj as a result of changes to legislation in the xxmaj netherlands , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup vi on particular methods for applying the legislation of certain xxmaj member xxmaj states . 4.1.9 xxmaj the changes made to the various annexes to xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 serve a number of purposes that the xxmaj committee wishes to highlight . xxmaj firstly , they simplify the wording of the text , thereby making it easier to implement and to understand . xxmaj progress is thus made along the lines laid down by xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 on the coordination of social security schemes , the aim of which is to simplify and update this coordination whilst complying with national social security legislation . xxmaj the xxmaj committee therefore supports these amendments . xxmaj secondly , some national laws have introduced new allowances for certain circumstances , reflecting advances in the social regulations of these xxmaj states . xxmaj the xxmaj committee therefore wishes to express its satisfaction at any advances made in social rights in the different xxmaj member xxmaj states , but regrets that citizens of the countries involved in the most recent enlargement should be subjected to specific administrative obstacles . 4.1.10 xxmaj lastly , the xxmaj committee is of the view that xxmaj annex xxup ii , xxmaj section xxup ii of the xxmaj regulation should be deleted . xxmaj member xxmaj states should take account of the case - law of the xxmaj court of xxmaj justice stating that childbirth and adoption allowances are not special allowances but family benefits and thus exportable . xxmaj we would like to see the xxmaj member xxmaj states accepting this legal reality , before the xxmaj court of xxmaj justice extends it to the xxmaj union as a whole , by means of judgments . 4.2 xxmaj council xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 574 / 72 laying down the procedure for implementing xxmaj regulation ( xxup eec ) xxmaj no 1408 / 71 . 4.2.1 xxmaj article 2 of the proposal amends four articles of the xxmaj regulation , all referring to healthcare in the event of accidents at work or occupational diseases . 4.2.2 xxmaj article 60 ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) on benefits in kind in the case of a stay in a xxmaj member xxmaj state other than the competent xxmaj state are deleted . xxmaj notification procedures that are not in practical use are deleted . xxmaj the xxmaj committee agrees with any measure that simplifies or eliminates pointless bureaucracy . 4.2.3 xxmaj article 62 , on benefits in kind in the case of a stay in a xxmaj member xxmaj state other than the competent xxmaj state , is replaced . xxmaj the introduction of the xxmaj european xxmaj health xxmaj insurance xxmaj card eliminates unnecessary procedures which would in any event be resolved between the competent xxmaj member xxmaj state institutions and not by the individual , and the wording remains the same as xxmaj article 21 of the xxmaj regulation as amended by xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 631 / 2004 . xxmaj the xxmaj committee supports any amendment that improves citizens ' access to the benefits to which they are entitled . 4.2.4 xxmaj article 63 ( 2 ) on benefits in kind for workers who transfer their residence or return to their country of residence , and for workers authorised to go to another xxmaj member xxmaj state for medical treatment , is amended . xxmaj the amendment is required because of the reference made in this article to xxmaj article 60 ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , deleted by this proposed xxmaj regulation itself . 4.2.5 xxmaj article 66 ( 1 ) on disputes concerning the occupational nature of the accident or disease is amended to delete the reference to xxmaj article 20 of the xxmaj regulation , which was itself deleted by xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 631 / 2004 . 4.2.6 xxmaj the xxmaj committee supports all the amendments made , because they improve the xxmaj regulation by simplifying its content and cutting through red tape , insofar as these changes facilitate citizens ' contacts with public administrations . 5 . xxmaj conclusions 5.1 xxmaj the xxmaj committee broadly welcomes the proposed xxmaj regulation , subject to the comments made in this opinion . xxmaj we feel that simplifying and improving the text of xxmaj regulations xxmaj nos . 1408 / 71 and 574 / 72 to encourage the freedom of movement of persons within the xxmaj union 's borders is to be welcomed , but believe it would be even more useful for xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 to enter into force , because in itself it brings comprehensive and far - reaching simplification to the way xxmaj social xxmaj security xxmaj schemes are coordinated . 5.2 xxmaj since the xxmaj committee has not been able to consider the final wording of the lengthy legislative process leading to xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 referred to above , we believe that an own - initiative opinion on the matter should be drawn up forthwith , before the legislative process for the new implementing regulation that the xxmaj commission is now completing gets underway . 5.3 xxmaj we in the xxmaj committee wish to urge the xxmaj commission to conclude its proposal for an implementing regulation as swiftly as possible , and the xxmaj council and the xxmaj european xxmaj parliament to take rapid action on the legislative process for adopting the regulation , in order to prevent any repetition of the delay experienced during the processing of xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 , especially given that 2006 is to be designated xxmaj year of xxmaj mobility for xxmaj workers . 5.4 xxmaj as regards the envisaged reforms to the different annexes to xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 , the xxmaj committee calls for the reform referring to xxmaj section xxup ii of xxmaj annex xxup ii on special childbirth and adoption allowances to be deleted as soon as possible by agreement with the xxmaj member xxmaj states , which still retain the right to derogate . xxmaj brussels , 28 xxmaj september 2005 . xxmaj the xxmaj president of the xxmaj european xxmaj economic and xxmaj social xxmaj committee xxmaj anne -

       "xxbos [ pic ] | xxup commission xxup of xxup the xxup european xxup communities | xxmaj brussels , xxup com ( 2004 ) xxmaj proposal for a xxup directive / / â€¦ â€¦ xxup ec xxup of xxup the xxup european xxup parliament xxup and xxup of xxup the xxup council of [ ] â€¦ on reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterway vessels ( xxmaj codified version ) xxup explanatory xxup memorandum 1 . xxmaj in the context of a people â€™ s xxmaj europe , the xxmaj commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying xxmaj community law so as to make it clearer and more accessible to the ordinary citizen , thus giving him new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives him . xxmaj this aim can not be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times , often quite substantially , remain scattered , so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones . xxmaj considerable research work , comparing many different instruments , is thus needed to identify the current rules . xxmaj for this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if xxmaj community law is to be clear and transparent . 2 . xxmaj on 1 xxmaj april 1987 the xxmaj commission therefore decided [ 1 ] to instruct its staff that all legislative acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments , stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible , to ensure that the xxmaj community rules are clear and readily understandable . 3 . xxmaj the xxmaj conclusions of the xxmaj presidency of the xxmaj edinburgh xxmaj european xxmaj council ( xxmaj december 1992 ) confirmed this [ 2 ] , stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time . xxmaj codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal xxmaj community legislative procedure . xxmaj given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the xxmaj european xxmaj parliament , the xxmaj council and the xxmaj commission have agreed , by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 xxmaj december 1994 , that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast - track adoption of codification instruments . 4 . xxmaj the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of xxmaj council xxmaj directive 76 / 135 / xxup eec of 20 xxmaj january 1976 on reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterway vessels [ 3 ] . xxmaj the new xxmaj directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it [ 4 ] , this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself . 5 . xxmaj the codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation , in all official languages , of xxmaj directive 76 / 135 / xxup eec and the instrument amending it , carried out by the xxmaj office for xxmaj official xxmaj publications of the xxmaj european xxmaj communities , by means of a data - processing system . xxmaj where the xxmaj articles have been given new numbers , the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in xxmaj annex xxup iii to the codified xxmaj directive . 76 / 135 / xxup eec ( adapted ) xxmaj proposal for a xxup directive / / â€¦ â€¦ xxup ec xxup of xxup the xxup european xxup parliament xxup and xxup of xxup the xxup council of [ ] â€¦ on reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterway vessels ( xxmaj text with xxup eea relevance ) xxup the xxup european xxup parliament xxup and xxup the xxup council xxup of xxup the xxup european xxup union , xxmaj having regard to the xxmaj treaty establishing the xxmaj european xxmaj community , and in particular xxmaj article 71 thereof , xxmaj having regard to the proposal from the xxmaj commission , xxmaj having regard to the opinion of the xxmaj european xxmaj economic and xxmaj social xxmaj committee [ 5 ] , xxmaj having regard to the opinion of the xxmaj committee of the xxmaj regions [ 6 ] , xxmaj acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in xxmaj article 251 of the xxmaj treaty [ 7 ] , xxmaj whereas : 1 . xxmaj council xxmaj directive 76 / 135 / xxup eec of 20 xxmaj january 1976 on reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterway vessels [ 8 ] has been substantially amended [ 9 ] . xxmaj in the interests of clarity and rationality the said xxmaj directive should be codified . 76 / 135 / xxup eec xxmaj recital 1 ( adapted ) 2 . xxmaj reciprocal recognition of navigability licences for inland waterways vessels should be achieved with a view to improving the safety

out of workers for use by an undertaking in the framework of a public or a private contract , ( 5 ) xxmaj whereas any such promotion of the transnational provision of services requires a climate of fair competition and measures guaranteeing respect for the rights of workers , ( 6 ) xxmaj whereas the xxunk of the employment relationship raises problems with regard to the legislation applicable to the employment relationship , whereas it is in the interests of the parties to lay down the terms and conditions governing the employment relationship envisaged , ( 7 ) xxmaj whereas the xxmaj rome xxmaj convention of 19 xxmaj june 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations ( 4 ) , signed by 12 xxmaj member xxmaj states , entered into force on 1 xxmaj april 1991 in the majority of xxmaj member xxmaj states , ( 8 ) xxmaj whereas xxmaj article 3 of that xxmaj convention provides , as a general rule , for the free choice of law made by the parties , whereas , in the absence of choice , the contract is to be governed , according to xxmaj article 6 ( 2 ) , by the law of the country , in which the employee habitually carries out his work in performance of the contract , even if he is temporarily employed in another country , or , if the employee does not habitually carry out his work in any one country , by the law of the country in which the place of business through which he was engaged is situated , unless it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country , in which case the contract is to be governed by the law of that country , ( 9 ) xxmaj whereas , according to xxmaj article 6 ( 1 ) of the said xxmaj convention , the choice of law made by the parties is not to have the result of depriving the employee of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory rules of the law which would be applicable under paragraph 2 of that xxmaj article in the absence of choice , ( 10 ) xxmaj whereas xxmaj article 7 of the said xxmaj convention lays down , subject to certain conditions , that effect may be given , concurrently with the law declared applicable , to the mandatory rules of the law of another country , in particular the law of the xxmaj member xxmaj state within whose territory the worker is temporarily posted , ( 11 ) xxmaj whereas , according to the principle of precedence of xxmaj community law laid down in its xxmaj article 20 , the said xxmaj convention does not affect the application of provisions which , in relation to a particular matter , lay down choice - of - law rules relating to contractual obligations and which are or will be contained in acts of the institutions of the xxmaj european xxmaj communities or in national laws harmonized in implementation of such acts , ( 12 ) xxmaj whereas xxmaj community law does not preclude xxmaj member xxmaj states from applying their legislation , or collective agreements entered into by employers and labour , to any person who is employed , even temporarily , within their territory , although his employer is established in another xxmaj member xxmaj state , whereas xxmaj community law does not forbid xxmaj member xxmaj states to guarantee the observance of those rules by the appropriate means , ( 13 ) xxmaj whereas the laws of the xxmaj member xxmaj states must be coordinated in order to lay down a nucleus of mandatory rules for minimum protection to be observed in the host country by employers who post workers to perform temporary work in the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state where the services are provided , whereas such coordination can be achieved only by means of xxmaj community law , ( 14 ) xxmaj whereas a ' hard core ` of clearly defined protective rules should be observed by the provider of the services notwithstanding the duration of the worker 's posting , ( 15 ) xxmaj whereas it should be laid down that , in certain clearly defined cases of assembly and / or installation of goods , the provisions on minimum rates of pay and minimum paid annual holidays do not apply , ( 16 ) xxmaj whereas there should also be some flexibility in application of the provisions concerning minimum rates of pay and the minimum length of paid annual holidays , whereas , when the length of the posting is not more than one month , xxmaj member xxmaj states may , under certain conditions , derogate from the provisions concerning minimum rates of pay or provide for the possibility of derogation by means of collective agreements , whereas , where the amount of work to be done is not significant , xxmaj member xxmaj states may derogate from the provisions concerning minimum rates of pay and the minimum length of paid annual holidays , ( 17 ) xxmaj whereas the mandatory rules for minimum protection in force in the host country must not prevent the application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers , ( 18 ) xxmaj whereas the principle that undertakings established outside the xxmaj community must not receive more favourable treatment than undertakings established in the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state should be upheld , ( 19 ) xxmaj whereas , without prejudice to other provisions of xxmaj community law , this xxmaj directive does not entail the obligation to give legal recognition to the existence of temporary employment undertakings , nor does it prejudice the application by xxmaj member xxmaj states of their laws concerning the hiring - out of workers and temporary employment undertakings to undertakings not established in their territory but operating therein in the framework of the provision of services , ( 20 ) xxmaj whereas this xxmaj directive does not affect either the agreements concluded by the xxmaj community with third countries or the laws of xxmaj member xxmaj states concerning the access to their territory of third - country providers of services , whereas this xxmaj directive is also without prejudice to national laws relating to the entry , residence and access to employment of third - country workers , ( 21 ) xxmaj whereas xxmaj council xxmaj regulation ( xxup eec ) xxmaj no 1408 / 71 of 14 xxmaj june 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the xxmaj community ( 5 ) lays down the provisions applicable with regard to social security benefits and contributions , ( 22 ) xxmaj whereas this xxmaj directive is without prejudice to the law of the xxmaj member xxmaj states concerning collective action to defend the interests of trades and professions , ( 23 ) xxmaj whereas competent bodies in different xxmaj member xxmaj states must cooperate with each other in the application of this xxmaj directive , whereas xxmaj member xxmaj states must provide for appropriate remedies in the event of failure to comply with this xxmaj directive , ( 24 ) xxmaj whereas it is necessary to guarantee proper application of this xxmaj directive and to that end to make provision for close collaboration between the xxmaj commission and the xxmaj member xxmaj states , ( 25 ) xxmaj whereas five years after adoption of this xxmaj directive at the latest the xxmaj commission must review the detailed rules for implementing this xxmaj directive with a view to proposing , where appropriate , the necessary amendments , xxup have xxup adopted xxup this xxup directive : xxmaj article 1 xxmaj scope 1 . xxmaj this xxmaj directive shall apply to undertakings established in a xxmaj member xxmaj state which , in the framework of the transnational provision of services , post workers , in accordance with paragraph 3 , to the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state . 2 . xxmaj this xxmaj directive shall not apply to merchant navy undertakings as regards seagoing personnel . 3 . xxmaj this xxmaj directive shall apply to the extent that the undertakings referred to in paragraph 1 take one of the following transnational measures : ( a ) post workers to the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state on their account and under their direction , under a contract concluded between the undertaking making the posting and the party for whom the services are intended , operating in that xxmaj member xxmaj state , provided there is an employment relationship between the undertaking making the posting and the worker during the period of posting , or ( b ) post workers to an establishment or to an undertaking owned by the group in the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state , provided there is an employment relationship between the undertaking making the posting and the worker during the period of posting , or ( c ) being a temporary employment undertaking or placement agency , hire out a worker to a user undertaking established or operating in the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state , provided there is an employment relationship between the temporary employment undertaking or placement agency and the worker during the period of posting . 4 . xxmaj undertakings established in a non - member xxmaj state must not be given more favourable treatment than undertakings established in a xxmaj member xxmaj state . xxmaj article 2 xxmaj definition 1 . xxmaj for the purposes of this xxmaj directive , ' posted worker ` means a worker who , for a limited period , carries out his work in the territory of a xxmaj member xxmaj state other than the xxmaj state in which he normally works . 2 . xxmaj for the purposes of this xxmaj directive , the definition of a worker is that which applies in the law of the xxmaj member xxmaj state to whose territory the worker is posted . xxmaj article 3 xxmaj terms and conditions of employment 1 . xxmaj member xxmaj states shall ensure that , whatever the law applicable to the employment relationship , the undertakings referred to in xxmaj article 1 ( 1 ) guarantee workers posted to their territory the terms and conditions of employment covering the following matters which , in the xxmaj member xxmaj state where the work is carried out , are laid down : - by law , regulation or administrative provision , and / or - by collective agreements or arbitration awards which have been declared universally applicable within the meaning of paragraph 8 , insofar as they concern the activities referred to in the xxmaj annex : ( a ) maximum work periods and minimum rest periods , ( b ) minimum paid annual holidays , ( c ) the minimum rates of pay , including overtime rates , this point does not apply to supplementary occupational retirement pension schemes , ( d ) the conditions of hiring -

significant ` . 6 . xxmaj the length of the posting shall be calculated on the basis of a reference period of one year from the beginning of the posting . xxmaj for the purpose of such calculations , account shall be taken of any previous periods for which the post has been filled by a posted worker . 7 . xxmaj paragraphs 1 to 6 shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers . xxmaj allowances specific to the posting shall be considered to be part of the minimum wage , unless they are paid in reimbursement of expenditure actually incurred on account of the posting , such as expenditure on travel , board and lodging . 8 . ' xxmaj collective agreements or arbitration awards which have been declared universally applicable ` means collective agreements or arbitration awards which must be observed by all undertakings in the geographical area and in the profession or industry concerned . xxmaj in the absence of a system for declaring collective agreements or arbitration awards to be of universal application within the meaning of the first subparagraph , xxmaj member xxmaj states may , if they so decide , base themselves on : - collective agreements or arbitration awards which are generally applicable to all similar undertakings in the geographical area and in the profession or industry concerned , and / or - collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers ' and labour organizations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory , provided that their application to the undertakings referred to in xxmaj article 1 ( 1 ) ensures equality of treatment on matters listed in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this xxmaj article between those undertakings and the other undertakings referred to in this subparagraph which are in a similar position . xxmaj equality of treatment , within the meaning of this xxmaj article , shall be deemed to exist where national undertakings in a similar position : -

employed persons and to members of their families moving within the xxmaj community and xxmaj council xxmaj regulation ( xxup eec ) xxmaj no 574 / 72 laying down the procedure for implementing xxmaj regulation ( xxup eec ) xxmaj no 1408 / 71 \" ( xxup com ( 2004 ) 830 final xxup cod 2004 / xxunk â€” ) ( 2006 / c 24 / 09 ) xxmaj on 14 xxmaj january 2005 , the xxmaj council decided to consult the xxmaj european xxmaj economic and xxmaj social xxmaj committee , under xxmaj article 251 of the xxmaj treaty establishing the xxmaj european xxmaj community , on the abovementioned proposal . xxmaj the xxmaj section for xxmaj employment , xxmaj social xxmaj affairs and xxmaj citizenship , which was responsible for the xxmaj committee 's work on the subject , adopted its opinion on 5 xxmaj september 2005 ( xxmaj rapporteur : xxmaj mr xxmaj rodrÃ­guez xxmaj garcÃ­a - xxmaj caro ) . xxmaj at its 420th plenary session held on 28 and 29 xxmaj september 2005 ( meeting of 28 xxmaj september ) , the xxmaj european xxmaj economic and xxmaj social xxmaj committee adopted the following opinion with 171 votes in favour and four abstentions . 1 . xxmaj introduction 1.1 xxmaj since their adoption , xxmaj regulations xxmaj nos . 1408 / 71 and 574 / 72 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self - employed persons and to members of their families moving within the xxmaj community have been successively amended to accommodate the changes that these schemes and the benefits they provide have undergone in the course of time . 1.2 xxmaj these changes basically consist of bringing the xxmaj regulations into line with the legislative amendments that have been made in the xxmaj member xxmaj states and adapting them to the successive rulings of the xxmaj european xxmaj court of xxmaj justice . xxmaj consequently , the proposed xxmaj regulation now submitted for the xxmaj committee 's consideration aims to reflect the changes that have taken place in national legislation , principally in the new xxmaj member xxmaj states , and to complete the simplification of procedures on receiving medical treatment abroad , extending this modification to the procedures regarding benefits for eventualities arising from accidents at work and occupational diseases . 1.3 xxmaj the last modification made to the two xxmaj regulations was produced by xxmaj regulation 631 / 2004 [ 1 ] , which introduced the aforementioned changes to the procedures for receiving medical treatment in another xxmaj member xxmaj state . xxmaj the xxmaj committee delivered an opinion [ 2 ] on the regulation at the draft stage . 1.4 xxmaj nevertheless , the most substantial change to the coordination of social security schemes in the xxup eu xxmaj member xxmaj states was made by xxmaj regulation 883 / 2004 [ 3 ] of the xxmaj european xxmaj parliament and of the xxmaj council which , after six years of discussion in the xxmaj union 's institutions , has been adopted and published in the xxmaj official xxmaj journal of the xxmaj european xxmaj union . xxmaj this xxmaj regulation , replacing xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 , has not yet entered into force , pending adoption of its xxmaj implementing xxmaj regulation , which will in turn replace the current xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 574 / 72 . xxmaj the xxup eesc delivered an opinion [ 4 ] on the proposal for a xxmaj regulation on the coordination of social security schemes when it was presented by the xxmaj commission . 2 . xxmaj content of the proposal 2.1 xxmaj the proposal presents modifications to two xxmaj regulations , firstly xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 and secondly xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 574 / 72 establishing the implementing procedures of the former . xxmaj the two sets of amendments are not related to one another , because they arise from different legal aspects , as stated in point 1.2 of this xxmaj opinion . 2.1.1 xxmaj as regards xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 , modifications are made to several of its annexes . xxmaj these address particular situations in the different xxmaj member xxmaj states , which must be referred to specifically in these annexes if the citizens of those countries are to benefit accordingly . 2.1.2 xxmaj as regards xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 574 / 72 , the modifications simplify the text and reduce the current administrative burden when healthcare is received for accidents at work or occupational diseases in another xxmaj member xxmaj state , applying the same criteria for simplifying procedures for receiving general healthcare as set out in xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 631 / 2004 . 3 . xxmaj general comments 3.1 xxmaj the xxmaj committee welcomes the content of the proposal because it considers that this pursues the approach of improving and simplifying the procedures aimed at better coordination of social security schemes in the xxmaj european xxmaj union . xxmaj any change that benefits xxup eu citizens and improves their relationship with the public authorities in the xxmaj member xxmaj states will always be welcomed by this xxmaj committee . 3.2 xxmaj we also welcome the proposed regulation because it specifically promotes one of the four freedoms on which the xxmaj european xxmaj union was originally founded â€” the free movement of workers and now , and by extension of this right , the free movement of those persons affected by these rules . xxmaj the xxmaj committee must therefore once again call for the various xxmaj union and xxmaj member xxmaj state bodies to move ahead with eliminating all existing obstacles , in order to create both a genuine area of free movement for persons within the xxmaj union 's borders , and a real social right . xxmaj we welcome the content of the proposal , because it constitutes a new means of promoting a fundamental right , which applies to all citizens . 3.3 xxmaj the co - decision procedure , because of its lengthy nature , may result in significant changes to the content of the proposals . xxmaj in an earlier xxmaj committee opinion [ 5 ] , on a proposal for partial amendments to the two regulations , we expressed our views on the need to participate and to give our opinion in real time , especially when dealing with this type of proposal , which relates to changes in socio - occupational legislation . xxmaj this view was ratified in another later xxup eesc opinion [ 6 ] , which argued that we should have the opportunity to comment on any changes made to texts during the decision - making procedure . xxmaj for these reasons , we would restate the need to take account of the xxup eesc 's role in this type of procedure . 3.4 xxmaj the situation described in point 3.3 has become even clearer with the adoption and publication of xxmaj regulation 883 / 2004 [ 7 ] on the coordination of social security schemes . xxmaj the opinion [ 8 ] delivered by the xxmaj committee stated the need to monitor the progress of the proposal , given its complexity and the certainty of changes to the text during the legislative process . xxmaj four years after the opinion was delivered , the xxmaj regulation has been adopted without the xxup eesc having again stated its views on the text . xxmaj given the importance of these types of rules and the crucial importance of the xxup eesc 's opinion being heard in good time , the xxmaj committee calls for the consultation procedure to be adapted to make the role played by organised civil society in the xxmaj union 's legislative procedure more effective . xxmaj equally , and in order to explain the view expressed by the xxmaj committee in the aforementioned opinion , we believe an own - initiative opinion should be drawn up on the new xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 on the coordination of social security schemes , which will eventually replace the current xxmaj regulation 1408 / 71 . 3.5 xxmaj similarly , the xxmaj committee considers that the consultative role of the xxmaj advisory xxmaj committee on xxmaj social xxmaj security for xxmaj migrant xxmaj workers , set up by xxmaj title v of xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 should be performed in exact compliance with the provisions of that regulation . xxmaj this committee , formed principally of trade union and employers ' representatives , is the forum through which socio - economic agents convey their views directly to the institutions , in the form of opinions or proposals , on the changes that need to be made to social security at xxmaj community level . 3.6 xxmaj article 90 of xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 states that xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 shall be repealed , except under certain circumstances , and xxmaj article 91 states that this xxmaj regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day after its publication in the xxmaj official xxmaj journal . xxmaj the second paragraph of the latter article states , however , that it shall apply from the date of entry into force of the xxmaj implementing xxmaj regulation . xxmaj for this reason , and given the forthcoming launch , in 2006 , of the xxmaj european xxmaj year of xxmaj workers ' xxmaj mobility , the xxmaj committee calls on the xxmaj union 's institutions and the xxmaj member xxmaj states to ensure that the procedure for drawing up and adopting the future implementing xxmaj regulation is as speedy and effective as possible so that the provisions of the new coordinating xxmaj regulation can enter into force to replace the complex provisions that make up the current xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 at the earliest opportunity . 4 . xxmaj specific comments 4.1 xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons , to self - employed persons and to members of their families moving within the xxmaj community . 4.1.1 xxmaj article 1 of the proposal amends annexes i , xxup ii , iia , xxup iii , xxup iv and xxup vi of the xxmaj regulation . 4.1.2 xxmaj in order to incorporate the changes that have taken place in xxmaj slovak legislation , an amendment is made to xxmaj annex i , section xxup ii , which refers to the personal scope of the regulation as regards the meaning of the term \" member of the family \" . 4.1.3 xxmaj due to changes in xxmaj french legislation , an amendment is made to xxmaj annex xxup ii , section i , on special schemes for self - employed persons which are excluded from the scope of the xxmaj regulation . 4.1.4 xxmaj in order to reflect changes to legislation in xxmaj estonia , xxmaj latvia and xxmaj poland respectively , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup ii , section xxup ii on special childbirth or adoption allowances that are excluded from the scope of the xxmaj regulation . xxmaj this annex is also amended as regards xxmaj luxembourg , as a consequence of a xxup ecj ruling stipulating that special allowances for childbirth or adoption can not be excluded from the xxmaj regulation and are exportable family benefits . 4.1.5 xxmaj due to various updates and adaptations to the corresponding legislation in xxmaj germany , xxmaj latvia , xxmaj poland and xxmaj slovakia , amendments are made to xxmaj annex iia of the xxmaj regulation , concerning special non - contributory benefits . 4.1.6 xxmaj in order to eliminate unnecessary points and thus simplify its content , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup iii.a concerning provisions for social security agreements that continue to apply despite the xxmaj regulation 's provision on deleting them . xxmaj amendments are also made for the same purpose to xxmaj annex xxup xxunk on the provisions of social security agreements which do not apply to all persons to whom the xxmaj regulation applies . xxmaj the numbering is adjusted , and bilateral agreements that fulfil the conditions for being listed in the annex are included . 4.1.7 xxmaj due to an incorporation into the legislation of the xxmaj czech xxmaj republic , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup xxunk covering national legislation under which the amount of invalidity benefits is independent of the length of periods of insurance . xxmaj for the same reason and with regard to the xxmaj czech xxmaj republic and xxmaj estonia , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup xxunk , on cases where the double pension calculation may be waived as it will never lead to a higher result . xxmaj as a result of changes to legislation in xxmaj slovakia , an amendment is made to xxmaj annex xxup iv . d on the benefits and agreements regarding the overlapping of benefits of the same kind to which persons are entitled under legislation in two or more xxmaj member xxmaj states . 4.1.8 xxmaj as a result of changes to legislation in the xxmaj netherlands , amendments are made to xxmaj annex xxup vi on particular methods for applying the legislation of certain xxmaj member xxmaj states . 4.1.9 xxmaj the changes made to the various annexes to xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 serve a number of purposes that the xxmaj committee wishes to highlight . xxmaj firstly , they simplify the wording of the text , thereby making it easier to implement and to understand . xxmaj progress is thus made along the lines laid down by xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 on the coordination of social security schemes , the aim of which is to simplify and update this coordination whilst complying with national social security legislation . xxmaj the xxmaj committee therefore supports these amendments . xxmaj secondly , some national laws have introduced new allowances for certain circumstances , reflecting advances in the social regulations of these xxmaj states . xxmaj the xxmaj committee therefore wishes to express its satisfaction at any advances made in social rights in the different xxmaj member xxmaj states , but regrets that citizens of the countries involved in the most recent enlargement should be subjected to specific administrative obstacles . 4.1.10 xxmaj lastly , the xxmaj committee is of the view that xxmaj annex xxup ii , xxmaj section xxup ii of the xxmaj regulation should be deleted . xxmaj member xxmaj states should take account of the case - law of the xxmaj court of xxmaj justice stating that childbirth and adoption allowances are not special allowances but family benefits and thus exportable . xxmaj we would like to see the xxmaj member xxmaj states accepting this legal reality , before the xxmaj court of xxmaj justice extends it to the xxmaj union as a whole , by means of judgments . 4.2 xxmaj council xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 574 / 72 laying down the procedure for implementing xxmaj regulation ( xxup eec ) xxmaj no 1408 / 71 . 4.2.1 xxmaj article 2 of the proposal amends four articles of the xxmaj regulation , all referring to healthcare in the event of accidents at work or occupational diseases . 4.2.2 xxmaj article 60 ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) on benefits in kind in the case of a stay in a xxmaj member xxmaj state other than the competent xxmaj state are deleted . xxmaj notification procedures that are not in practical use are deleted . xxmaj the xxmaj committee agrees with any measure that simplifies or eliminates pointless bureaucracy . 4.2.3 xxmaj article 62 , on benefits in kind in the case of a stay in a xxmaj member xxmaj state other than the competent xxmaj state , is replaced . xxmaj the introduction of the xxmaj european xxmaj health xxmaj insurance xxmaj card eliminates unnecessary procedures which would in any event be resolved between the competent xxmaj member xxmaj state institutions and not by the individual , and the wording remains the same as xxmaj article 21 of the xxmaj regulation as amended by xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 631 / 2004 . xxmaj the xxmaj committee supports any amendment that improves citizens ' access to the benefits to which they are entitled . 4.2.4 xxmaj article 63 ( 2 ) on benefits in kind for workers who transfer their residence or return to their country of residence , and for workers authorised to go to another xxmaj member xxmaj state for medical treatment , is amended . xxmaj the amendment is required because of the reference made in this article to xxmaj article 60 ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , deleted by this proposed xxmaj regulation itself . 4.2.5 xxmaj article 66 ( 1 ) on disputes concerning the occupational nature of the accident or disease is amended to delete the reference to xxmaj article 20 of the xxmaj regulation , which was itself deleted by xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 631 / 2004 . 4.2.6 xxmaj the xxmaj committee supports all the amendments made , because they improve the xxmaj regulation by simplifying its content and cutting through red tape , insofar as these changes facilitate citizens ' contacts with public administrations . 5 . xxmaj conclusions 5.1 xxmaj the xxmaj committee broadly welcomes the proposed xxmaj regulation , subject to the comments made in this opinion . xxmaj we feel that simplifying and improving the text of xxmaj regulations xxmaj nos . 1408 / 71 and 574 / 72 to encourage the freedom of movement of persons within the xxmaj union 's borders is to be welcomed , but believe it would be even more useful for xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 to enter into force , because in itself it brings comprehensive and far - reaching simplification to the way xxmaj social xxmaj security xxmaj schemes are coordinated . 5.2 xxmaj since the xxmaj committee has not been able to consider the final wording of the lengthy legislative process leading to xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 referred to above , we believe that an own - initiative opinion on the matter should be drawn up forthwith , before the legislative process for the new implementing regulation that the xxmaj commission is now completing gets underway . 5.3 xxmaj we in the xxmaj committee wish to urge the xxmaj commission to conclude its proposal for an implementing regulation as swiftly as possible , and the xxmaj council and the xxmaj european xxmaj parliament to take rapid action on the legislative process for adopting the regulation , in order to prevent any repetition of the delay experienced during the processing of xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 883 / 2004 , especially given that 2006 is to be designated xxmaj year of xxmaj mobility for xxmaj workers . 5.4 xxmaj as regards the envisaged reforms to the different annexes to xxmaj regulation xxmaj no 1408 / 71 , the xxmaj committee calls for the reform referring to xxmaj section xxup ii of xxmaj annex xxup ii on special childbirth and adoption allowances to be deleted as soon as possible by agreement with the xxmaj member xxmaj states , which still retain the right to derogate . xxmaj brussels , 28 xxmaj september 2005 . xxmaj the xxmaj president of the xxmaj european xxmaj economic and xxmaj social xxmaj committee xxmaj anne -
